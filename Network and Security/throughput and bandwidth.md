## Analogy

1. Bandwidth is like the width of a road(theoretical value), while Throughput is like the actual car flow on the road.
2. They are have the same measurement bits/second.

## Bandwidth

Static value, usually determinded by the transmission medium(copper wire , fibre optic).

## Throughput

Dynamic value. It depends on a lot of factors, like the network congestions, bandwidth, delays, packet loss and the protocals.
