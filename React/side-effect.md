What is side effect when we talk about hook in React?

- In functional programming, everything that has nothing to do with computing is called side effect. If you have a function that does contain some operations about side effect, the function will not be called pure function.

- pure function. It refers to functions that, given the same input, will always produce the same output (without side effects such as network requests, changing file system, or global state) and do not produce any side effects.

- The characteristics of pure functions include not changing the global variables (which includes not changing the parameters passed in), not performing I/O operations, etc.
