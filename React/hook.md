# What is hook in React?
1. Functional components are great in React. For pure functions, you can just return the value(which is 'html stuff' in React). But what if you need to do something more complex? Hooks can help you do more tasks in one function and hooks are essentially functions as well.
2. Hooks will generate side effects.

# Types of hooks
- useState: manage the state of component
- useContext: manage the context
- useRef: manage the refference
- useEffect: general use of side effects, when you dont know what specific hooks to use.
