The term "callback hell" refers to a situation in JavaScript where you have several nested callbacks, leading to code that is hard to read and maintain. This often happens when you're dealing with multiple asynchronous operations that need to occur in a specific sequence. Each operation requires a callback, and if these operations are dependent on the results of the previous ones, you end up nesting these callbacks within each other. Here's an example to illustrate this:

```js
function f1(callback){
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("f1 comlete");
    callback();
  }, 1000);
}

function f2(callback){
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("f2 comlete");
    callback();
  }, 1000);
}

function f3(){
  setTimeout(() =>{
    console.log("f3 complete");
    },1000);
}

f1(function()=>{
    f2(function(){
        f3();
    });
})

```
