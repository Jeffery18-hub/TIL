In JavaScript, `!=` and `!==` are both inequality operators, but they differ in how they compare values:



1. `!=` (Inequality Operator):

   - This operator tests for inequality.

   - It converts (coerces) the operands to the same type before making the comparison.

   - If the operands are of different types, JavaScript attempts to convert them to suitable types for the comparison, which can sometimes lead to unexpected results due to type coercion.

   - For example, `"5" != 5` will return `false` because the string `"5"` is coerced to the number `5` before the comparison.



2. `!==` (Strict Inequality Operator):

   - This is the strict version of the inequality operator.

   - It returns `true` if the operands are not equal and/or not of the same type.

   - This operator does not perform type coercion. If the operands are of different types, the operator immediately evaluates to `true`.

   - For example, `"5" !== 5` will return `true` because the operands are of different types (string and number), and no type conversion is performed.



In general, it is recommended to use the strict inequality operator `!==` in JavaScript. This is because it avoids the potential confusion and errors that can arise due to implicit type conversions with the non-strict inequality operator `!=`. The strict operator provides a more predictable and consistent behavior, especially in cases where the types of the operands might not be guaranteed.
